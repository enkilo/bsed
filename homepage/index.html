<b>bsed</b> is a program that I wrote early in my career, at AT&T
Teletype.  It can do simple edits in binary files from the command line or a
shell script.  It has come in handy many times and I thought it might be of
use to other people as well so while I was releasing other tools I decided
to release this one as well.  It is available under the
<a href=../sources/bsedsrc/COPYING>GNU General Public License</a>.
